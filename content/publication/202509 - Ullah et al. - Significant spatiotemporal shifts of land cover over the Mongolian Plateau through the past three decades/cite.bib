abstract = {Land cover (LC) change is a crucial indicator reflecting the interaction between human activities and ecological environment. In semi-arid and arid regions like the Mongolian Plateau (MP), LC change analysis is particularly meaningful in shaping biodiversity, agricultural and grassland environment, and climate regulation, but long-term spatiotemporal dynamics of LC change in MP remain uncertain. This study employed an intensity analysis approach to investigate LC changes over the MP from 1990 to 2020 by using a fine-scale 30 m resolution land cover dataset generated from multi-source satellite images. The results indicate that LC types including desert steppe and croplands exhibit aggressive expansion in MP region, while key categories such as shrub, wetland, sand, and some grassland types, especially meadow steppe, experience considerable loss in the time frame. Notably, forest cover remained a relatively stable category over the study period. The dominant LC transitions between categories show that meadow steppe lost more than 40 % of its area to real steppe during most of the study period, along with significant shifts from shrub to real steppe, desert steppe, cropland, and bare area. The LC changes on the MP were significantly high during 1990 to 2000, while 2015–2020 records the lowest rates of change. The research provides valuable insights into LC dynamics in MP in long-term, offering essential information for policy-making and sustainable agricultural and grassland development in ecologically fragile areas.}
